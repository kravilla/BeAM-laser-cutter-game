    <ul>
        <li>
            The goal of the game is to create a simulated environment where users can manipulate a limited number of elements in a mock design interface and settings on a laser cutter to see what happens to their end product when they change different things
        </li>
        <li>
            Since the client requires the game to be equipped with the property that all trainees could have access to the game at the same time and trainees are able to practice the game by themselves after the training session, we came to the conclusion that the platform of the game will be web-based. The length of the game will be approximately 10-minute-long
        </li>
        <li>
            The game will be used as a mocking training tool used both in training session by instructors and by participants themselves. Generally, the game is aimed to provide exercises on both the “DESGIN” and “OPERATION” preparation sections before users deliver orders to the laser cutting machine.

                    Form: simulative operating interface with three steps
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>project design and upload image to operator </li>
                    <li>Color-instructing setting on laser cutting: (with RGB color settings: Red color implies cutting operation. Blue implies etch. Black implies raster)</li>
                    <li>real cutting with position adjustment</li>

                </ul>
                <li>Include assessment implementations in the game and reflect results of the game:</li>
                <ul><li>- For example, on which section the members made the most mistakes so that trainers can make adjustments to their instruction.</li></ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The genre of the game will be simulation game.
        </li>
        <li>
            It will be a bonus to collect some basic data from the game about the trainings such as which procedural steps students made most mistakes, the least, etc

        Include assessment implementations in the game and reflect results of the game. For example, on which section the members made the most mistakes so that trainers can make adjustments to their instruction.
