Tomorrow is mother’s birthday! 
She has been out of town for nearly one month because of her work. 
I truly hope she still remember her husband and two lovely children. 
What might be an appropriate present at such a busy time…
Right! A photo frame would be a good one. Mother can put a family picture in it and place it on her desk. 
The frame will definitely remind her of her lovely lovely little son!
But how and where should I make this stuff? It has to be done quickly and nicely.
Isn’t it cool if I use the laser cutter to make something for her?
A cool person like mum would absolutely love it!
Speaking of making something… I do remember UNC has a network of makerspaces.
One of them is right at Murray hall!
Let’s go and check it out!
